### StockX web scrap and data analysis
Scrapes stockx for multiple shoes to get information such as name, brand, price, release date, colorway, and transaction data for each shoe. Data not uploaded to repo because its a lot.

Run setup.sh to create necessary file structure (not even sure if necessary)

Run scraper.py to get all the raw data (takes really long time)

Run data_formatter.py to format all the data and store it in the shoe_data folder
